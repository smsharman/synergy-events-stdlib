= synergy-events-stdlib

This library provides common functions for the Synergy Integration Architecture for retrieving and storing config info, sending events to topics and so on.

== Usage

*set-up-topic-table [arnPrefixAtom eventStoreTopicAtom thisSSM]* - set the default ARN and Event Store atoms passed in using values retrieved from AWS SSM. thisSSM is a Cognitect AWS library ssm instance.

*set-up-route-table [routeTableAtom thisSSM thisS3]* - look up S3 bucket and routing table filename from AWS SSM, retrieve the routing table JSON, convert to a map and assign that map to the atom passed as routeTableAtom. thisSSM and thisS3 are Cognitect AWS ssm and s3 clients.

*gen-status-map [status-code status-message return-value]* - pass in a map of status code (true/false), a status string e.g. "failed-validation" and an arbitrary map of status indicators; return a standard status map in format:
----
{:status true/false :status-message "message" :return-value {:key1 "val2" :key2 "val2"}
----

*send-to-topic [topic event arnPrefix thisSNS note]* - send the standard Synergy message format event event to the topic identified by arnPrefix:topic using a Cognitect AWS sns client instantiated into thisSNS. The value of note is used in the log written as the message is dispatched.

*send-to-topic [topic event arnPrefix thisSNS]* - as above, but with the note field set to "".

*validate-message [inbound-message]* - validate the Synergy namespaced format message passed in against the standard message spec. Return a status map (as above) with the result - if the message does not validate, then the return-value includes the output of the explain? function to explain the validation failure.

*check-event-type [event]* - pass in an arriving event, and this function will identify it as one of the following SQS, SNS, S3, Cloudwatch (timer) or HTTP API (from the API gateway).

*get-event-data [event src-type]* - pass in the source event and the event-type as above, and this function returns the body content of the event passed in.
